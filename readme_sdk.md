## Tools & Repositories

**[edgeai-tidl-tools](https://github.com/TexasInstruments/edgeai-tidl-tools)**: This repository contains examples developed for TI Deep Learning Library/Product (TIDL) and Deep learning runtime (DLRT) offering provided by TIâ€™s edge AI solutions. This repository also provides model compilation tools that can help to compile DNN models (see the releases of this repository) and also run inference on PC (simulation). The resulting compiled model artifacts can be used to deploy AI applications on the SDK to achieve optimal performance. DLRT is packaged as part of the EdgeAI SDK.
