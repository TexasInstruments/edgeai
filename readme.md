## Introduction
This repository provides several **tools for AI**, including Deep Learning, traditional Machine Learning and Computer Vision. 

Embedded Inference of Deep Learning models is quite challenging - due to high compute requirements. The tools provided here help to optimize and accelerate inference on embedded devices.
