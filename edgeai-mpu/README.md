## Introduction

Embedded inference of Deep Learning models is quite challenging - due to high compute requirements. TI’s Edge AI comprehensive software product help to optimize and accelerate inference on TI’s embedded devices. It supports heterogeneous execution of DNNs across cortex-A based MPUs, TI’s latest generation C7x DSP and DNN accelerator (MMA). 

TI's Edge AI solution simplifies the whole product life cycle of DNN development and deployment by providing a rich set of tools and optimized libraries.
