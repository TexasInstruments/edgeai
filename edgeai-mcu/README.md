## What is New
- [2025-January] Major feature updates (version 1.0.0) of the software
  - Tiny ML Modelmaker is now a pip installable package!
  - Feature Extraction transforms are now modular and compatible with C2000Ware 5.05 only
  - Multiclass ROC-AUC graphs are autogenerated for better explainability of reports and help select thresholds based on false alarm/ sensitivity preference
  - Run now begins with displaying inference time, sram usage and flash usage for all the devices for any model.
  - Supports Haar and Hadamard Transform
  - Golden test vectors file has one set uncommented by default to work OOB
  - Existing models can be modified on the fly through a config file (check Tiny ML Modelmaker docs)
  - PCA graphs are auto plotted for feature extracted data â†’ Helps in identifying if the feature extraction actually helped
- [2024-November] Updated (version 0.9.0) of the software
- [2024-August] Release version 0.8.0 of the software
- [2024-July] Release version 0.7.0 of the software
- [2024-June] Release version 0.6.0 of the software
