**[edgeai-gst-apps](https://github.com/TexasInstruments/edgeai-gst-apps)**: These are plug-and-play deep learning applications which support running open source runtime frameworks such as TFLite, ONNX and NeoAI-DLR with a live camera and display. They help connect realtime camera, video or RTSP sources to DL inference to live display, bitstream or RTSP sinks.

Apart from the applications that are part of edgeai-gst-apps, other example applications are also available at https://github.com/TexasInstruments. Look for forks of [edgeai-gst-apps](https://github.com/TexasInstruments/edgeai-gst-apps) that contains more examples.
